=====
* write three programs that all do the same thing!
* all of these programs should:
  * print out the same four lines from your favorite song
  * each line of lyrics should be printed out on a new line
  * for example, if your program prints out the song, 'On a Tropical Island', 
    the output would look like (of course, with three version, imagine this
    three times): 

On a tropical island,
Underneath a molten lava moon.
Hangin' with the hula dancers,
Askin' questions cause' they got all the answers.

* there are multiple ways of printing out strings on new lines:
  * maybe it's just one command
  * or several commands
  * or use different ways of representing strings, putting strings 
    together, or incorporating newlines
* write THREE DIFFERENT versions of this program in this file

You can't let one precious day slip by.
Look inside yourself, and if you don't see what you want,
Maybe sometimes then you don't,
But leave your mind alone and just get high.""")

Give up the funk\n
Ow, we need the funk\n
We gotta have that funk""")
